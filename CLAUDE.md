# Coder Workspace Images Repository

This repository contains Docker build files and initialization scripts for Coder workspace images. It provides standardized development environments with pre-configured tooling and automated setup scripts.

## Key Architecture Concepts

### Base Image Pattern
- All specialized images inherit from `base-dev/`
- Base image provides: Docker-in-Docker, GCP CLI, GitHub CLI, Node.js, AI coding tools
- Language-specific images add their own tooling and init scripts

### Initialization System
- Master init script: `workspace-images/base-dev/init-workspace.sh` (copied to `/usr/local/bin/`)
- Language-specific scripts placed in `/usr/local/share/workspace-init.d/`
- Auto-executed by Coder agent on workspace startup
- Handles: Docker daemon, authentication, shell configuration, GCP secrets

### Shell Configuration
- Uses Starship prompt with Lion theme
- Configurations only apply to new shell sessions (not current init context)
- Changes to `.bashrc` require `exec bash` or workspace restart to see effects

## Working with This Repository

### Automated CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions automatically build and push multi-arch Docker images to GCP Artifact Registry
- Triggers on changes to `workspace-images/*/` directories or workflow files
- Uses native ARM64 and AMD64 runners for optimal performance
- Images pushed to `us-central1-docker.pkg.dev/coder-nt/workspace-images/`
- Tagged with both `:latest` and `:sha-{commit}` for version control

### Modifying Init Scripts
1. Edit the master script in `workspace-images/base-dev/init-workspace.sh`
2. Push changes to trigger automatic Docker build via GitHub Actions
3. New images automatically available in GCP Artifact Registry
4. Test in new workspace to verify changes

### Adding New Language Support
1. Create new directory under `workspace-images/`
2. Write Dockerfile that extends base-dev
3. Add language-specific init script to `/usr/local/share/workspace-init.d/`
4. Copy GitHub Actions workflow from existing image, update IMAGE_NAME
5. Push changes to trigger automated build

### Manual Building (if needed)
- Use standard Docker build commands in each image directory
- Base image must be built first as foundation for others
- GitHub Actions preferred for consistency and multi-arch support

## Environment Variables

### Authentication
- `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_PAT`: GitHub CLI authentication
- `CODER_GCP_PROJECT`: Enables automatic GCP secrets discovery and loading

### GCP Integration
When `CODER_GCP_PROJECT` is set, init scripts automatically:
- Discover all secrets in the GCP project
- Load secret values as environment variables
- Make secrets available in all shell sessions

## Important Implementation Notes

- Init scripts run in non-interactive shell context during workspace creation
- Shell configuration changes only affect future sessions, not current execution
- Docker daemon requires specific permission fixes in `/run` and `/var/run`
- Starship prompt changes won't be visible until new interactive shell starts

## GitHub Actions Workflow Details

### Multi-Architecture Build Strategy
- Builds native on ARM64 (`ubuntu-24.04-arm`) and AMD64 (`ubuntu-latest`) runners
- Uses `push-by-digest` to build each architecture separately
- Merges digests into single multi-arch manifest with `docker buildx imagetools create`
- Automatically cleans up individual digest versions to reduce registry clutter

### Build Triggers
- **Path-based**: Changes to `workspace-images/{image-name}/**` or workflow files
- **Manual**: `workflow_dispatch` for on-demand builds
- **Authentication**: Uses workload identity with `GCP_SA_KEY` secret

### Image Tagging Strategy
- `:latest` - Always points to most recent build
- `:sha-{7-char-commit}` - Specific commit-based tag for reproducibility

## Common Tasks

- **Update base tools**: Modify `base-dev/Dockerfile` and `init-workspace.sh`, push to trigger build
- **Add language support**: Create new image directory, copy/modify GitHub Actions workflow
- **Debug build issues**: Check GitHub Actions logs, verify GCP authentication
- **Debug init issues**: Check `/usr/local/bin/init-workspace.sh` exists and is executable
- **Test shell config**: Use `exec bash` or restart workspace to see prompt changes
- **Troubleshoot secrets**: Verify `CODER_GCP_PROJECT` is set and GCP authentication works
- **Monitor builds**: Watch GitHub Actions for build status and multi-arch manifest creation

This repository follows Docker best practices and Coder workspace patterns. All changes should maintain backward compatibility and follow the established initialization flow.
