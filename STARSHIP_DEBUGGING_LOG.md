# Starship Configuration Debugging Log

## Session: 2025-09-01 - Claude Agent Investigation

### Initial Problem
User reported that starship config wasn't applying properly in the init-workspace.sh script, despite multiple previous attempts to get it working before first workspace launch.

### Investigation Results

#### Environment Check (2025-09-01 18:26)
```bash
# Starship is installed correctly
which starship ‚Üí /usr/local/bin/starship

# Config file exists and is properly formatted
ls -la ~/.config/starship.toml ‚Üí -rw-r--r-- 1 coder coder 897 Sep  1 18:26

# BUT: No starship init line found in .bashrc
grep -n "starship" ~/.bashrc ‚Üí No starship found in .bashrc
```

#### Current Shell State
- Shell: `/bin/bash`
- Starship installed: ‚úÖ 
- Config file present: ‚úÖ
- `.bashrc` integration: ‚ùå Missing

#### Manual Test
```bash
# Manual initialization worked perfectly
eval "$(starship init bash)"
# ‚Üí Starship prompt immediately appeared with lion theme
```

### Root Cause Analysis

The issue is **NOT** with the init script logic - it's a timing/context problem:

1. **Init Script Logic is Correct**: Lines 106-125 in `init-workspace.sh` properly:
   - Check for existing starship init
   - Add the eval line to `.bashrc`
   - Include error handling and verification

2. **Execution Context Issue**: The init script runs during workspace creation in a non-interactive shell, so:
   - Changes to `.bashrc` don't affect the current session
   - Starship prompt only appears in NEW shell sessions
   - The script itself can't "see" the prompt changes it makes

3. **This Workspace Instance**: The starship init line was missing from `.bashrc`, suggesting either:
   - This workspace was created with an older version of the init script
   - The init script failed to run completely
   - There was an error during the `.bashrc` modification

### Fix Applied This Session
```bash
# Added the missing starship init line manually
echo 'eval "$(starship init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc

# Verified it was added
tail ~/.bashrc | grep starship ‚Üí eval "$(starship init bash)"
```

### Key Insight: Expected Behavior
**This is actually NORMAL behavior** - the init script is working correctly. When users create a new workspace:

1. Init script runs and configures everything properly
2. User's first terminal session shows default prompt (expected)
3. User needs to either:
   - Open a NEW terminal tab/window, OR
   - Run `exec bash` to reload shell config
   - Then starship prompt appears

### Verification Steps for Future Sessions

When testing if starship config worked:

```bash
# 1. Check if starship is installed
which starship

# 2. Check if config file exists
ls -la ~/.config/starship.toml

# 3. Check if .bashrc has the init line
grep "starship.*init.*bash" ~/.bashrc

# 4. If all above are ‚úÖ but prompt not showing, run:
exec bash
# OR start a new terminal session
```

### Recommendations

1. **For Users**: After workspace creation, always start a new terminal session or run `exec bash` to see shell customizations

2. **For Init Script** (if we want immediate feedback): Consider adding a note at the end:
   ```bash
   echo "ü¶Å Starship prompt configured! Run 'exec bash' or open a new terminal to see it."
   ```

3. **For Documentation**: Update user guides to explain that shell customizations require a new session

### Status: ‚úÖ RESOLVED (2025-09-01 20:15)

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: The startup script order was incorrect in the Terraform template.

**The Real Problem**:
1. Init script ran and correctly added starship to `.bashrc`
2. THEN the startup script ran `cp -rT /etc/skel ~` which **OVERWROTE** the modified `.bashrc`
3. All starship configuration was lost due to this ordering bug

**Fix Applied**: 
- Modified `workspace-templates/repo-devcontainer/repo-devcontainer.tf` 
- Moved skeleton copy to happen BEFORE init scripts (lines 243-247)
- Now order is: skeleton copy ‚Üí init scripts ‚Üí starship works ‚úÖ

**Files Changed**:
- `repo-devcontainer.tf:240-253` - Fixed startup script execution order

### Next Claude Agent Notes
If you're investigating starship issues:
1. Check the startup script order in the Terraform template first
2. Skeleton copy MUST happen before init scripts, not after
3. The init script logic was always correct - it was a timing/ordering issue
4. New workspaces created with the fixed template should work immediately
